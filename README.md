## Projects & Reports
Analyzed network packets using Wireshark and interpreted DNS/HTTP traffic across lab sessions to 
detect suspicious activity, data exfiltration, and protocol anomalies 
• Performed web application testing using Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP, identifying OWASP Top 10 
vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, and insecure input validation 
• Executed vulnerability assessments with Nessus and Nmap, uncovering 10+ CVEs, open ports, and 
misconfigurations across 3 environments, improving patch deployment and system visibility 
• Simulated real-world attacks using Metasploit, successfully exploiting known CVEs and gaining shell 
access to demonstrate post-exploitation risks 
• Detected unpatched systems in lab environments and emphasized the importance of patch 
management and secure configuration baselines 
• Conducted static code analysis with SonarQube, identifying injection flaws, code smells, and 
recommending 10+ secure coding practices to reduce vulnerability exposure 
• Verified file integrity using MD5/SHA-1 hashes in HashCalc and analyzed malicious samples using 
VirusTotal to detect malware payloads and phishing indicators 
• Presented findings and demonstrated OWASP Top 10 attacks and mitigations to support developer 
awareness and improve secure development practices
